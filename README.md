# Crowd-Sourcing App - Mapa

### Overview

Mapa is a simple crowdsourcing app that allows users to identify the location of points of interests typically not found in other map apps. The first version of this app we are allowing the community to mark where bicyle racks, water fountains, and bathrooms are so that others may get directions to these locations.
